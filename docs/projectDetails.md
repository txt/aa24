# Project Details

The premise of this paper is that a remarkably small number of samples does remarkably well. Please confirm/ correct/ extend/ refute that premise using SE-related problems.

- **20 repeats** of
  - **Several variants** of some sampling technique (plus random selection, so at least three)
    - **Applied to  some task** (by default, you will probably be working some multi-objective optimization problem for SE/ But please consider project [idea#6](projects.md)
      - Applied to  **10-20 data sets** you understand and can **motivate** their application in an SE context
        - Analyzed with the **[statistics](04stats.md) introduced in class** (please show me you understand that when we reason about stochastic devices, we need to discuss not just middle behaviour, but also variations about that middle)

What to hand in:
- A pdf generated by latex  in the [IEEE Access](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-access-latex-template/cdxrhtbjgszv) format (no bios or pictures at back)
- The first line of the latex must be `\documentclass{ieeeaccess}`.
- Do not mess with font sizes, line heights, column widths, margins, etc etc. Your paper really needs to look like:

## Headings for report:

For an example of a paper with many of these headings, 
see  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10438420.


|Section | Subsections (these subsections may be in ant order) | Notes|
|---------|------------|-------|
 |Abstract|             |  State the problem, your approach and solution, and the main contributions of the paper. Include little if any background and motivation. Be factual but comprehensive. The material in the abstract should not be repeated later word for word in the paper.|
 |Introduction |      |  Often consist of five paragraphs answering the following five questions: <br>1. What is the problem?<br>2. Why is it interesting and important?<br>3. Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)<br>4. Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does mine differ?)<br>5. What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations.|
|         | Research Questions | |
|         | Contributions  | |
 |        | Structure  | This is a one para section that starts with "The rest of this paper is structured as follows".|
Background  |    | Often includes related work plus a general overview of the field before going into details (in later sections)|
|Algorithms|       | Show me you understand   the code you use, that you can make a sensible case for the variants you explore, and that you can explain those variants.<br>If you are using some well-established algorithm from the literature, show me you understand it and tell me why you are using it.|
|Methods |        | The details
 |       | Data | Here you need to show me you understand data. Pick data set for which you can make a business  justification that they are actually solving an SE problem|
 |      | Experimental Set up | What you ran. Why. If you made "magic parameter choices" (e.g. I used a k=5 nearest neighbor), justify those choices (e.g. that is what was done in that famous paper) |
  |      | Evaluation metrics  | How you scored each run|
  |      | Statistical Methods | Please show me you understand what is effect size and a significance test |
|Results|                    | Divide into the research questions (and each research question section ends with a paragraph,in bold, summarize what is your answer to that question|
|Discussion | What was Learned| And what was surprising|
 |            | Threats to Validity| For a table of such threats, see Table 1 of [^feldt]. For  an example of  threats to validity section, see section V.D of [^peters]|
 |           | Future work | if you have done this work right, there should be 1000 things you know you could have done, but did not do. Which of those d you recommend to others as important next steps?)|
|Conclusion | | summarize the why and how of the paper and what was learned (perhaps mentioning some of the details of the results)|
|References| | |
 



## Selection of Data

What ever data, you use, at least half of it has to solve some interesting SE problem. When, in you report you describe your data, it had better come with a  good justification of why it represents a good SE problem.


- For example data, see https://github.com/txt/aa24/tree/main/data.
  - For notes on those data sets, look for any PDF or .md file in that directory.
  - Do NOT use
    - anything in health
    - anything in Process/large


## Selection of Models

If you don't want to use my data, then feel free to do something else.

You can generate data from other models (e.g. see  https://pymoo.org/problems/test_problems.html)
- as long as  at least half your results come from an SE domain
- so if you are going to to use DTLZ, make sure you use something else as well

## Grading Rubric

Points | Notes
-----|-------
-40 | Not using the Latex IEEE access template
-10 | Poor Essay Stricture: We want coherent paragraphs, not a bullet list. References are used in a way that enhances the argument. Paragraphs should be content-full (rather that a set of irrelevances). Arguments should be defended and not just be opinions of the form "I think that..." (with no supporting clauses). Each section should start with some clarification/structuring preamble.
 -5 | If not 20 repeated trails with different seeds (exception: if you are using some ultra slow deep learning thing then make the case in the text that such slow processes cannot be explored more some small number (perhaps even one))
-5 | If you do not compare to some kind of random selection
-5 | If you results have no effect size test
-5 | If your results have no significance test
-5 | If shorter than 8 pages
-5 | If longer than 13 pages (including references)
-5 | if your text does not justify the use of your data from an SE perspective (exception: using DTLZ is ok just as long as you as it is only half your data sets)
-3 | For each of the above headings missing
-5 | You include those sections but the section is just badly done.
-3 | If you have have figures or tables that are no discussed in the text.
-2 | If your text mentions figures or tables that are not in the paper.
